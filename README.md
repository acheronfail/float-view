# Float View

A tool to view rides recorded with [Float Control]. I made it so I could easily analyze specific parts of my ride when troubleshooting custom boards. The Float Control app was too laggy and slow, plus I wanted all the information easily visible.

Use it here: <https://acheronfail.github.io/float-view/>!

## Demo

Also works great on mobile devices:

And can be saved as an app to your phone's home screen, by:

1. Opening the website in your browser
2. Clicking the Share button
3. Selecting `Add to Home Screen`

Now you'll have `Float View` all the time, even offline!

## How do I use it?

1. Get on your board and record a ride with [Float Control]
2. Export your ride data as a `csv` file (Float Control will put it in a `.zip`)
3. Open the zip, and load it up in <https://acheronfail.github.io/float-view/>
4. Enjoy!
